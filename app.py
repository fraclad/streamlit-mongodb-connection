                In this Streamlit app, we showcase the seamless integration of MongoDB with Streamlit using the `ExperimentalBaseConnection` module that works on top of the official pymongo package. 
                
                For demonstration purposes, this application uses MongoDB M0 free cluster with limited storage. The dataset used is a directory of the current US senate. 
                
                The app utilizes a custom `MongoDBConnection` class to establish a connection to a MongoDB server and interact with its databases and collections. 
                
                By leveraging the power of Streamlit's new `experimental_connection` capabilities, we provide an intuitive and interactive user interface to use data from MongoDB 
                and display the results in real-time. 
                
                The codebase for this application can be found from [this github repository](https://github.com/fraclad/streamlit-mongodb-connection).
